	Java                provides the java.util.regex package for pattern 
matching with regular expressions. Java regular expressions 
are very similar to the Perl programming language and very 
easy to learn.

	A regular expression is a special sequence of characters 
that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings,
 using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. They can be used 
to search, edit, or manipulate text and data.
